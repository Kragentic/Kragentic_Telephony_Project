# Product Requirements Document (PRD) -- Modular AI Communication Platform

## 1. Overview

The Modular AI Communication Platform (MCP) is designed to manage inbound and outbound calls using AI-powered voice agents. It integrates with Twilio for telephony, LiveKit for real-time voice streaming, STT (Speech-to-Text), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and LLM-based conversational AI (OpenAI/Claude). The platform supports RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), CAG (Conversational Augmentation), campaign logic, list management, compliance features (e.g., consent before recording), and deployment on Fly.io for scalability and resilience.

## 2. Goals and Objectives

- Provide a modular, extensible communication system.
- Automate call handling (inbound & outbound).
- Support compliance with regulations (e.g., consent for call recording).
- Enable real-time AI-powered voice interactions.
- Ensure scalability and global deployment via Fly.io.
- Provide analytics and reporting for administrators.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Call Handling

- Inbound and outbound calls via Telnyx integration.
- Call dispatch rules:
  - Pre-check if consent is required.
  - Ask for user consent before recording the call.
  - Route to AI agent or human fallback based on logic.
  - If Client Use Cuss Words ,, Then  Terminate The Call and Blacklist The Client.

### 3.2 AI Agents

- Modular AI agents built with LangChain and OpenAI/Claude APIs.
- STT (Google Speech API, SpeechRecognition, or Whisper).
- TTS (gTTS, pyttsx3, or ElevenLabs API optional).
- Voice streaming through LiveKit.

### 3.3 Compliance & Consent

- AI agent prompts user for consent before recording.
- If declined, disable recording but continue call.
- Store consent logs securely.

### 3.4 Campaign & Dispatch Rules

- Contact list manager with scheduling and retry rules.
- Campaign configuration for outbound calls.
- Dispatch rules engine for routing based on:
  - User consent
  - Agent availability
  - Priority or business logic.

### 3.5 RAG/CAG Augmentation

- Knowledge-base retrieval with LangChain.
- AI responses augmented with customer-specific or domain data.
- Conversation history stored for context continuity.

### 3.6 Analytics & Logging

- Call logs (metadata, transcripts, outcomes).
- Dashboard with:
  - Total calls (inbound/outbound)
  - Consent acceptance rates
  - Agent performance metrics
  - Campaign success rates

### 3.7 Deployment (Fly.io)

- Modular monolith backend in Elixir & Python deployed on Fly.io.
- Global deployment with autoscaling.
- Cloudflare for CDN, DNS, and security.

### 3.8 Security & Privacy

- Secure storage of call recordings and transcripts.
- Encrypted databases for contact lists.
- Role-based access control for admin/operator/agent.

## 4. Architecture Overview

**Components:**
- Frontend: React (Agent/Manager dashboard).
- Backend: Elixir (telephony logic) + Python (AI orchestration).
- Telephony: Twilio for PSTN/SIP.
- Streaming: LiveKit for real-time audio.
- AI Layer: OpenAI/Claude via LangChain for LLM.
- RAG Layer: LangChain retrievers (vector DB).
- Database: PostgreSQL (Fly.io-hosted).
- Deployment: Fly.io + Cloudflare.

**Flow Example (Inbound Call):**
1. Caller dials business number (Twilio).
2. MCP receives webhook, LiveKit starts audio stream.
3. AI agent answers, requests consent for recording.
4. Call routed per dispatch rules (AI agent, human agent, voicemail).
5. Transcript logged, analytics updated.

## 5. User Roles

- Administrator: Configure system, campaigns, compliance policies.
- Agent: Handle calls (AI-assisted or manual fallback).
- End-user (caller): Customer interacting with AI/human agent.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- Scalability: Autoscale on Fly.io, global edge routing.
- Reliability: Failover routing to backup agents.
- Security: Encryption, GDPR/CCPA compliance.
- Performance: <300ms round-trip latency for voice streaming.
- Extensibility: Plug-in architecture for AI models or rules.

## 7. Future Extensions

- Multi-channel support (WhatsApp, SMS, Email).
- Predictive outbound dialing.
- Sentiment analysis & emotion detection.
- Advanced analytics (dashboards, BI tools).
- CRM integrations (HubSpot, Salesforce).
- Multi-language STT/TTS with dynamic translation.

## 8. Success Metrics

- Call connection success rate > 99%.
- Consent compliance rate = 100%.
- Average response latency < 500ms.
- Campaign success rates (customized per use case).
- AI agent resolution rate vs human fallback.

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

- Telephony outages (Twilio): Use fallback providers.
- Fly.io downtime: Multi-region deployment, Cloudflare failover.
- Data privacy violations: Strict encryption & compliance monitoring.
- AI inaccuracies: Human fallback routing, RAG augmentation.

## 10. Timeline (High-Level)

- Week 1-2: Setup infra (Fly.io, Cloudflare, Twilio, LiveKit).
- Week 3-4: Implement inbound/outbound call logic with consent handling.
- Week 5-6: Integrate AI agent (STT/TTS/LLM).
- Week 7-8: Add campaign manager & dispatch rules.
- Week 9-10: Implement analytics & dashboards.
- Week 11-12: Testing, QA, security review.
- Week 13: Production deployment.

## 11. Deliverables

- Working modular AI communication platform.
- Fly.io deployment with scaling.
- Admin dashboard (React).
- Documentation & PRD (this file).
